# ACCORDION RENTAL APP

#### Video Demo: <URL HERE>

## üëÄ Description

The **Accordion Rental App** is a web-based platform that streamlines the rental process for musical instruments, focusing on accordions.

The Django admin panel provides tools for managing:

- User data
- Instruments
- Contracts
- Invoices
- Agreements

For Users:

- Guests
  Guests can browse available and rented instruments. Rented instruments are displayed with their expected return dates.
- Registered Users
  After registering, users can reserve instruments temporarily while deciding. Since rental rates are dynamic (based on the rental period), users are given a short decision window.

Once a rental agreement is submitted:

- A PDF agreement, generated in the user‚Äôs profile-selected language, is automatically emailed.
- Invoices are created based on the user‚Äôs language preference and chosen payment interval. New invoices are checked and emailed daily.

Users can view their contracts and invoices on their dashboard and download them as PDFs.

Before the rental period ends, an automated reminder is sent, prompting the user to coordinate with the lessor about either returning the instrument or extending the contract. If the admin does not mark the instrument as "returned," the agreement is extended automatically.

For Staff:
Users with "staff" status are redirected to an admin dashboard where they can:

- Track payments and upload bank statement XML files
- Send notifications,
- Update contract statuses (e.g., "digitally signed," "instrument returned").

Statuses can be updated manually using buttons on the interface.

Additional features for staff include:

- Sending short emails via a message form.
- Editing an "additional info" field.
- Sorting contracts by various fields for better tracking of payments due or advance payments.

## üëá Key Features

- User Profiles:
  Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles.
- Instrument Management:
  Users can browse and reserve instruments, with real-time availability and pricing updates..
- Agreements and Invoices:
  Rental agreements and invoices are generated and sent automatically based on user preferences.
- Automate remainders:
  Notifications are sent to users before the end of their rental period, ensuring proactive communication.
- Admin Dashboard:
  Staff can manage contracts, update statuses, track payments, and send messages.
- Email Notifications:
  Custom email messages can be sent directly from the admin dashboard.
- JWT Authentication, csrf tokens:
  Ensures secure login and session management with access tokens.

source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run migrations to set up the database:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

5. Start the Django server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

#### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend folder:

```bash
cd accordion-rental/frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
